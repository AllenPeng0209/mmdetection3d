cd mmdet/ops/bev_ops
python setup.py install

// test and usage
cd gtest
for each function I have a gtest
(for gtest/test_iou_cuda.py I haven't written correct answers for repeated op)

// remember all the data passed to the function must have a type of float!!!!
// if u have any questions, contact me!!!!!!
